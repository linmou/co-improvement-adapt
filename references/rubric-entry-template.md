# Rubric Entry Template (Dependencies-Based)

Use this template for project rubric memory entries.

## Design Principle
A rubric entry is valid only when it is grounded in project context and intent assumptions.

## Required Fields
- `applicability`: where/when this rubric is valid.
- `decision_rule`: how to score or decide, with concrete score examples.
- `dependencies`: which context + intent assumptions this rubric depends on.
- `lifecycle`: retirement/sunset boundary metadata.

## Template
```md
### Rubric Entry
- id: RUB-<short-name>
- title: <clear rubric name>

- applicability:
  - include:
    - <where this rubric should be applied>
  - exclude:
    - <where this rubric should NOT be applied>

- decision_rule:
  - score_5_rule: <explicit high-quality condition>
  - score_5_support_examples:
    - <support example that matches score_5_rule>
  - score_5_counter_examples:

## JSON Template (Preferred for Storage)
Use this JSON shape when writing rubric files to `./.co-improvement/learnt/rubrics/<domain>/<rubric-id>.json`.

```json
{
    "id": "RUB-<short-name>",
    "title": "<clear rubric name>",
    "applicability": {
        "include": ["<where this rubric should be applied>"],
        "exclude": ["<where this rubric should NOT be applied>"]
    },
    "decision_rule": {
        "score_5_rule": "<explicit high-quality condition>",
        "score_5_support_examples": [
            "<support example that matches score_5_rule>"
        ],
        "score_5_counter_examples": [
            ["N/A for score 5 upper neighbor (+)", "<counter- should be scored as 4 (-)>"]
        ],
        "score_3_rule": "<explicit partial condition>",
        "score_3_support_examples": [

        ],
        "fail_fast": "<optional hard fail condition>"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "context_refs": [
            "<natural-language context from context memory>"
        ],
        "intent_refs": [
            "<natural-language intent from intent list>"
        ]
    },
    "lifecycle": {
        "sunset_condition": "<optional retirement condition>"
    }
}
```

### JSON Rules
- Use valid JSON only (no comments, no trailing commas).
- Use 4-space indentation.
- `score_X_support_examples` must be a list.
- `score_X_counter_examples` must be a list of pairs: `[[counter+, counter-], ...]`.
- Each counter pair should contrast one main feature and stay adjacent-level (`X+1` / `X-1`).

## Transformed Examples (from `references/rubric.md`)

Note: JSON template is source-of-truth for storage. Markdown examples are for readability only.

- dependencies:
  - context_refs:
    - AI and human's accuracy for E2E task is limited and easy to be fatigue.
  - intent_refs:
    - Decompose tasks to build clear workflow.

- lifecycle:
  - sunset_condition: Replace when decomposition standard is migrated.

### Example 2 — AI Improvement Loop Tightening
```md
### Rubric Entry
- id: RUB-AI-IMPROVEMENT-LOOP
- title: AI behavior tightening across iterations

- applicability:
  - include:
    - Tasks with iterative co-improvement cycles.
  - exclude:
    - One-shot outputs without iterative revision.

- decision_rule:
  - score_5_rule: Mid-loop context/rubric update mechanism is explicit and alignment improves across rounds.
  - score_5_support_examples:
    - "Round 2 and 3 show explicit rubric updates and fewer correction comments."
  - score_5_counter_examples:
    - ["N/A for score 5 upper neighbor (+)", "Rounds include explicit updates, but mismatch reduction is weak and inconsistent. (-)"]
  - score_3_rule: Feedback loop exists but behavior tightening is weak or inconsistent.
  - score_3_support_examples:
    - "Feedback is recorded, but next round still repeats prior mismatch patterns."
  - score_3_counter_examples:
    - ["Feedback is recorded and next round reduces most mismatch patterns. (+)", "Feedback is recorded, but next round shows almost no measurable change. (-)"]
  - score_1_rule: Static one-shot generation with no update loop.
  - score_1_support_examples:
    - "Single pass output and no iteration record."
  - score_1_counter_examples:
    - ["At least one explicit revision loop exists, but quality gain is minimal. (+)", "N/A for score 1 lower neighbor (-)"]
  - fail_fast: No mechanism to feed human feedback back into AI behavior.

- dependencies:
  - context_refs:
    - AI must improve with iteractive human feedback on AI performance.
  - intent_refs:
    - Reduce repeat errors and improve alignment.

- lifecycle:
  - sunset_condition: Retire if loop protocol is replaced by a new iteration framework.

### Example 3 — Effort Minimization
```md
### Rubric Entry

- applicability:
  - include:
    - Workflows with clear AI-executable bulk operations.
  - exclude:
    - The most safety-critical and high risk steps requiring mandatory human execution. 

- decision_rule:
  - score_5_rule: Human effort is focused on steering/judgment (<30%), while bulk execution is offloaded to AI.
  - score_5_support_examples:
    - "Human only sets constraints and final ranking; AI executes drafting, sampling, and summarization."
  - score_5_counter_examples:
    - ["N/A for score 5 upper neighbor (+)", "Human only sets constraints and ranking, but still performs one avoidable manual extraction step. (-)"]
  - score_3_rule: Partial offloading exists but human still does avoidable micro-management.
  - score_3_support_examples:
    - "AI drafts output, but human manually rewrites most sections line-by-line."
  - score_3_counter_examples:
    - ["AI drafts output and human edits only key decision sections. (+)", "AI drafts output, but human also performs most routine formatting and extraction. (-)"]
  - score_1_rule: Human performs most mechanical work without need.
  - score_1_support_examples:
    - "Human executes routine formatting and extraction steps that AI could perform."
  - score_1_counter_examples:
    - ["AI handles part of routine operations, but human still performs many mechanical steps. (+)", "N/A for score 1 lower neighbor (-)"]
  - fail_fast: Workflow requires avoidable human micro-steps by design.

- dependencies:
  - context_refs:
    - Human only have limited time for a work and dont want to do the same thing again and again.
  - intent_refs:
    - Minimize human effort while maintaining quality.

- lifecycle:
  - sunset_condition: Revisit if quality drops under aggressive automation.
